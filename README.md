# RB_Internal-Assets
ok, this is the first table set of ajax function based crud actions. I have a few little kinks to work out, mainly with the 
table dependancies, but this will take the logged in user to views which will enable to read, create, update or delete records from the 
database. 
This will be included with Tamera's log in view to begin to build up the portal.
